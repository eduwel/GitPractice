3 things: git, github and markdown

1) Git is for version control; rolling log files and changes made to files**
Also describes what was changed.
Git is local – then can share
"Add" & "commit" to track and log changes

2) GitHub .. hosting site for various repositories. You can pool gits on hithub.
– make copies, edit, propose changes
– can also make copies of others, edit & propose changes;
= COLLABORATION

3) MARKDOWN
Styling or formatting text – light-weight style for docs; docs written in markdown more sustainable and transferable – decrease risk of losing info.

Initializing git -- i.e. pay attention to selected folder
textfile.md = "md" = markdown; 

accessing remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/eduwel/GitPractice

to confirm: git remote -v (will see fetch & push versions; intimates mutual awareness)

> Fill out student application for free repos in order to avoid paying monthly fee for private repos for github; can use git locally w/out issue

add = demos. interest in file (flagging?)
commit = commit changes made
push = moves to online repo

To "stage" type git add gitcheat.md
To "commit" type git commit -m "first commit" (-m = message about version)
